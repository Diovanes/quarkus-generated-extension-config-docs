`quarkus.resteasy.path`:: Set this to override the default path for JAX-RS resources if there are no
annotated application classes.

type: `java.lang.String`; default value: `/`. The configuration is visible at build time only. 


`quarkus.resteasy.singleton-resources`:: If this is true then JAX-RS will use only a single instance of a resource
class to service all requests.

If this is false then it will create a new instance of the resource per
request.

If the resource class has an explicit CDI scope annotation then the value of
this annotation will always be used to control the lifecycle of the resource
class.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: 'javax.ws.rs.Path' turns into a CDI stereotype
with singleton scope. As a result, if a user annotates a JAX-RS resource with
a stereotype which has a different default scope the deployment fails with
IllegalStateException.

type: `boolean`; default value: `true`. The configuration is visible at build time only.
