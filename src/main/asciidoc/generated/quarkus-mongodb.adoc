`quarkus.mongodb.application-name`:: Configures the application name.

type: `java.lang.String`; The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.mongodb.connect-timeout`:: How long a connection can take to be opened before timing out.

type: `java.time.Duration`. _See duration note below_; The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.mongodb.connection-string`:: Configures the connection string. The format is: `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database.collection][?options]]` 
 `mongodb://` is a required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format. 
 `username:password@` are optional. If given, the driver will attempt to login to a database after connecting to a database server. For some authentication mechanisms, only the username is specified and the password is not, in which case the ":" after the username is left off as well. 
 `host1` is the only required part of the connection string. It identifies a server address to connect to. 
 `:portX` is optional and defaults to :27017 if not provided. 
 `/database` is the name of the database to login to and thus is only relevant if the `username:password@` syntax is used. If not specified the `admin` database will be used by default. 
 `?options` are connection options. Note that if `database` is absent there is still a `/` required between the last host and the `?` introducing the options. Options are name=value pairs and the pairs are separated by "&". 
 An alternative format, using the `mongodb+srv` protocol, is:  mongodb+srv://[username:password@]host[/[database][?options]]   
 - `mongodb+srv://` is a required prefix for this format. 
 - `username:password@` are optional. If given, the driver will attempt to login to a database after connecting to a database server. For some authentication mechanisms, only the username is specified and the password is not, in which case the ":" after the username is left off as well 
 - `host` is the only required part of the URI. It identifies a single host name for which SRV records are looked up from a Domain Name Server after prefixing the host name with `"_mongodb._tcp"`. The host/port for each SRV record becomes the seed list used to connect, as if each one were provided as host/port pair in a URI using the normal mongodb protocol. 
 - `/database` is the name of the database to login to and thus is only relevant if the `username:password@` syntax is used. If not specified the "admin" database will be used by default. 
 - `?options` are connection options. Note that if `database` is absent there is still a `/` required between the last host and the `?` introducing the options. Options are name=value pairs and the pairs are separated by "&". Additionally with the mongodb+srv protocol, TXT records are looked up from a Domain Name Server for the given host, and the text value of each one is prepended to any options on the URI itself. Because the last specified value for any option wins, that means that options provided on the URI will override any that are provided via TXT records.

type: `java.lang.String`; The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.mongodb.credentials.auth-mechanism`:: Configures the authentication mechanism to use if a credential was supplied. The default is unspecified, in which case the client will pick the most secure mechanism available based on the sever version.

[NOTE]
====
The format for durations uses the standard `java.time.Duration` format.
You can learn more about it in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[Duration#parse() javadoc].

You can also provide duration values starting with a number.
In this case, if the value consists only of a number, the converter treats the value as seconds.
Otherwise, `PT` is implicitly appended to the value to obtain a standard `java.time.Duration` format.
