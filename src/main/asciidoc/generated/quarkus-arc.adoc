`quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans`:: If set to all (or true) the container will attempt to remove all unused beans.

An unused bean:

 - is not a built-in bean or interceptor,
 - is not eligible for injection to any injection point,
 - is not excluded by any extension,
 - does not have a name,
 - does not declare an observer,
 - does not declare any producer which is eligible for injection to any injection point,
 - is not directly eligible for injection into any {@link javax.enterprise.inject.Instance} injection point


If set to none (or false) no beans will ever be removed even if they are unused (according to the criteria
set out above)

If set to fwk, then all unused beans will be removed, except the unused beans whose classes are declared
in the application code
